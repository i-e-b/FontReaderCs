# FontReaderCs
A dead simple font reader and renderer, for experimentation 

Font "Dave.ttf" is by me, and is free to use.

Font "Guthen Bloots" is by Azetype86 and is free for personal use. For full commercial version, see ( https://crmrkt.com/d1b47b )

Font "NotoSans-Regular" is by Google, and is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

## Plans

* [x] Simple scanline renderer
* [x] Anti-aliasing and sub-pixel rendering
* [x] Try breaking curves in the font reader
* [x] Dark-on-light rendering (or better, proper coloring and alpha?)
* [ ] Basic auto hinting?
* [ ] Better sizing interface (rather than scale)
* [ ] Try a simple "directional signed distance field" renderer (scan lines in horizonal and vertical separately?)
