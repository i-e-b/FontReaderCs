# FontReaderCs
A dead simple font reader and renderer, for experimentation 

Font "Dave.ttf" is by me, and is free to use.

Font "Guthen Bloots" is by Azetype86 and is free for personal use. For full commercial version, see ( https://crmrkt.com/d1b47b )

## Plans

* [ ] Try a non-zero winding renderer
* [ ] Try a simple "directional signed distance field" renderer (scan lines in horizonal and vertical separately?)
